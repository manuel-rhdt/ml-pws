# ML-PWS: Machine Learning Implementation of Path Weight Sampling

ML-PWS is a Python package that implements Path Weight Sampling (PWS) models for time series analysis. It provides tools for computing mutual information in sequential data using autoregressive models and Monte Carlo Sampling, built with JAX, Flax, and PyTorch for efficient computation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) for dependency management

### Installing with uv

1. First, install uv if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manuel-rhdt/ml-pws.git
cd ml-pws
```

3. Create and activate a new virtual environment with uv:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

4. Install the package and its dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The package provides several scripts to recreate the figures from the paper:

1. Regenerate figure datasets:
```bash
make data
```
